# PHENIO vs uPHENO

## What is the difference between PHENIO and uPHENO?

PHENIO is an application ontology: it is a collection of other ontologies. These ontologies are designed to work together to make it easier to compare knowledge concerning phenotypes across species and genetic backgrounds.

uPHENO is part of PHENIO, but it is also its own ontology for comparing phenotypes. More detail here: <https://obophenotype.github.io/upheno/about/>
